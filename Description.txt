ISYS.ini File Generator 1.0

ISYS.ini File Generator 1.0 is a utility created for Commerce I.T. to automate the process of creating the ISYS.ini files for the INET program found in the Commerce computer labs. 

There is a central folder that contains a number of folders based on computers MAC addresses. Each PCs MAC address thus corresponds to one such folder. Each folder contains an ISYS.ini configuration file. What makes these files different is the unique IUser value found in each one. The program therefore automates the process of creating these unique folders and configuration files by parsing a text file containing a list of all the computer MAC addresses.
